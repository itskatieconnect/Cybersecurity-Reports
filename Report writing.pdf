WRITING AN INCIDENT REPORT

One critical skill for a SOC analyst is the ability to write clear reports that facilitate communication, improve processes, and safeguard the organisation.

A report should have

1. Introduction: Start with a brief overview of the incident and its significance.
2. Description: Clearly outline what happened
3. Analysis (The most important part): Break down the investigation steps, findings, and tools used.
3. Recommendations: Actionable steps to mitigate future risks.
4. Conclusion: Summarise the key takeaways and highlight the importance of preventive measures.

Recently, I worked on a simulated incident involving a phishing attack that led to the detection of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). 

It involved:
a. Detecting outbound traffic flagged by the SIEM tool.
b. Investigating a phishing attack that led to the download of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).
c. Mitigating the threat before sensitive data could be exfiltrated.
